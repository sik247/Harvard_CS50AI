## Course Overview

The CS50 AI course offers an introduction to artificial intelligence, covering essential topics such as search algorithms, game theory, and machine learning. The course is project-based, allowing hands-on practice with real-world applications of AI techniques.

## Project 1: Movie Star Finder

**Description**:
The Movie Star Finder project uses AI techniques to recommend movie stars based on various criteria. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict movie star recommendations.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Movie database APIs

**Key Learnings**:
- Implemented machine learning models for recommendation systems.
- Gained experience with data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Explored API integration for accessing movie and actor data.

## Project 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

**Description**:
The Tic-Tac-Toe AI project involves creating an intelligent agent that plays Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves and challenge human players effectively.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- Minimax Algorithm
- Basic AI Techniques

**Key Learnings**:
- Implemented the minimax algorithm for optimal decision-making.
- Learned about game theory and recursive algorithms.
- Developed a functional AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe.
